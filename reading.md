<h3> Contact Mechanics: </h3>

<p>
	<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144599360110"> "Rigid-Body Dynamics with Friction and Impact," D. Stewart (2000)</a>
</p>
<p>
	I highly recommend this paper if you're interesting in an easy to read introduction
	to single-point and multi-point rigid-body contact modeling using linear complementarity
	formulation with time-stepping. Has a lot of detail for numerical implementations and
	uses Newton restitution model.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/21f2/85aef8f93d540d7fd80d59e1514d9aabbd13.pdf"> "Time-stepping for three-dimensional rigid body dynamics," M. Anitescu et al. (1999)</a>
</p>
<p>
	An important companion paper to the one mentioned above. Gives a really nice modeling
	explanation and introduces elastic contact restitution for Poission.

<h3> Planning Through Contact: </h3>

<p>
	<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364913506757"> "A Direct Method for Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies Through Contact," M. Posa et al. (2014)</a>
</p>
<p>
	A great paper to get into planning through contact with rigid-body dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://stanford.edu/group/rexlab/papers/variational-ijrr.pdf"> "Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization Using Variational Integrators," Z. Manchester et al. (2014)</a>
</p>
<p>
	A great paper to read after reading Michael's paper above. Introduces higher order
	accuracy integration for the contact free motion, allowing bigger steps.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss14/p58.pdf"> "In-Hand Manipulation via Motion Cones," N. Chavan-Dafle et al. (2018)</a>
</p>
<p>
	Shows how to plan for in hand manipulation using stable frictional contacts.
	The planner is very fast and the video is very very nice.
