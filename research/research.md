    <h2>PhD Research</h2>
    
    <p>My PhD research is in the general area of robotic manipulation and contact. I specialize in:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Sytem identification and force estimation applied to rigid-body robotic systems,</li>
    <li>Contact modeling (simulations, analytical and learning approaches),</li>
    <li>Frameworks Probablistic inferences for rigid-body robotic systems.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Below are some examples of my work.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Inferring Parameters and Forces applied to Rigid-body Robots in Contact:</h3>
    
    <p>Let's assume we have a robotic system making contact with the environment, can we make inferences about
    the physical properties (such as masses, inertias, and contact parameters) of the robotic system? Can we
    also make inferences about the contact forces from the interaction?</p>
    
    <p>I have developed a mathematical framework that i) tells us explicitly what parameters/forces are
    identifiable, and ii) provides a formulation to compute these quantities given a time-series of observations.</p>
