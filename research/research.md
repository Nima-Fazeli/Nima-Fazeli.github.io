    <p>
		I am interested in <strong>Inference</strong>, <strong>Modeling/Simulation</strong>, 
		<strong>Control</strong>, and <strong>Learning</strong> applied to 
		<strong>Robotic Manipulation</strong>.
		I am interested in the complex and exciting world of physical interactions,
		these interactions are fundamental to the utility of real-world agents. Physical
		interactions are complex because they are <strong>hybrid</strong>, which means
		that the dynamics of the robot change as it comes into contact and whether the
		type of contact is permitted to stick or slide. These interactions are also
		<strong>difficult to model</strong> because of the complex nature of frictional
		contact. Though contact is complex, it provides us with a wealth of information
		which we can use to make <strong>inferences</strong> about the world. 
	</p>
    
    <p>
		I work on developing <strong>algorithms</strong> and 
		<strong>models</strong> that allow robots to intelligently and autonomously 
		interact and learn from their environement. I have worked on both 
		<strong>model-based</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> approaches
		and believe there is a world in which we can combine our knowledge of physcis
		and learning approaches to garner the best of both worlds.

		Here are some of the projects I have worked on in each catagory:

		<strong>Inferring robot parameters and contact forces during frictional interactions:</strong>
	</p>
	
    <p>
		Let's assume we have a robotic system making contact with the 
		environment, can we make inferences about the physical properties 
		(such as masses, inertias, and contact parameters) of the robotic system? Can we
		also make inferences about the contact forces from the interaction?
	</p>
    
    <p>
		In this project, I developed a mathematical framework that i) tells 
		us explicitly what parameters/forces are identifiable, and ii) provides 
		a formulation to compute these quantities given a time-series of observations,
		under the assumption of rigid-body frictional interactions.
