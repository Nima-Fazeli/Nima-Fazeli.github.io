    Getting Started In Robotics:
  </h2>

  <p>
		So you want to get started in robotics, where do you actually start?
	</p>

  <p>
		- <strong>ROS:</strong> Learn about the Robot Operating Systems. This wonderful software provides an architecture to integrate different components of robotic systems into a uniform communication platform. There are excellent tutorials and this is a great place to start.
	</p>
	<p>
		- <strong>Robot Platforms:</strong> Learn about the different kinds of robotic systems. These range from flying robots (UAVs) to locomoting robots (ATLAS, Cassie, ...) to arms (ABB, Baxters, ...). Each system has its own set of challenges and interesting nuggets and beginning by specializing is a really good idea. See which platform is most exciting to you, and follow that line. Do know a little about each before diving in though.
